# Dynamic_Difficulty

This project was my final project for university. 

The aim of this project was to develop a fairly simple game (tic tac toe),
and an existing AI system (Minimax),
To not play the game perfectly but to instead adjust the game's difficulty dynamically as the player plays games to provide the best user experience. 


This premise had a bunch of psychological studies around user experiencs with various video games but this was the application side of things.
